			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				Ever since I was a child, I've loved games. So it's no surprise that, like a moth to light, I was drawn to programming and 
				ended up studying Software Engineering at my local university. That was the start of my long adventure creating all kinds of games.
				Fighting games, casual games, racing games, puzzle games, even health apps! 
			</p>
			</p>	
				Like Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll in the lab, I love experimenting. I enjoy building quick and fascinating prototypes to bring my fellow team 
				members' ideas to life. I also enjoy helping teammates stay organized and facilitating smooth communication across different branches,
				from artists and designers to fellow devs.
			</p>
			<p>
				You could say I love to mingle among creative sparks and help turn them into full-blown creative explosions!
